# User Experience UX

## UX-strategy

The goal is to provide a blog website for users to post their thoughts and feelings on various subjects from books, tv shows to day to day life. 

**Developer Goals**
- Build portfoilio: 
- Develop technical skills:

The MVP of this project is simple but the app can be developed to include commenting on other posts, celebrating the post content, including images and potential monitisation through advertising or affliate links. 



**User Goals**
- Access to imformation and inspiration, what book will they read next or where will they travel to?
- Passing time reading content.

- Search blogs for a specific user or content. 
- Responsive design. Can be accessed on the go.

## UX-structure

**Navigation**
I have decoded to use a traditional navigation bar with links displaying to the relevant users.
Not logged in users will see - Home, Login and Register
Users will see - Home, Logout, New Blog, Profile
Admin users will see - Home, Logout, New Blog, Profile and manage categories. 

The Navigation bar collapses into a hamburger icon which users are familiar with on mobile devices.
